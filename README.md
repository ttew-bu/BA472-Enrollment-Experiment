# BA472_Experiment
Here is an experiment that I did with Brett Rado, Tiff Truong, James Cox, and Tanvi Agarwal for a business experimentation class. This project required that we create a research question, design an experiment, and analyze it using R to make actionable conclusions. Our research question was whether or not introducing a final group project instead of a final exam improves enrollment rates for other classes.
